### Project 1: 🖥️ Computer Quiz Project

This simple Python project is an interactive computer quiz game where users are presented with a series of questions. The user provides input to answer each question, and the program immediately checks if the answer is correct or not. At the end of the quiz, the program displays the total number of correct answers and calculates the user's score as a percentage.

This project is a great way to practice basic Python skills, including handling user input, conditional statements, and loops.
