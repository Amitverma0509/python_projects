## 🚀 Project Highlights

Here’s a sneak peek at some of the standout projects in this collection:

---

### Project 1: 🖥️ Computer Quiz Project

This simple Python project is an interactive computer quiz game where users are presented with a series of questions. The user provides input to answer each question, and the program immediately checks if the answer is correct or not. At the end of the quiz, the program displays the total number of correct answers and calculates the user's score as a percentage.

This project is a great way to practice basic Python skills, including handling user input, conditional statements, and loops.

### Project 2: Python Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple and interactive Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game prompts the user to enter a positive integer, which defines the range for a random number to be guessed. The user then attempts to guess the randomly generated number within the specified range. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. 
The game keeps track of the number of guesses taken by the user and displays the total once the correct number is guessed.
