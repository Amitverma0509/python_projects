## üì¶ About This Repository

This repository serves as a hub for all my Python-related projects, regardless of their size or complexity. Each project is organized

## üöÄ Project Highlights

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at some of the standout projects in this collection:

---

### Project 1: üñ•Ô∏è Computer Quiz Project

This simple Python project is an interactive computer quiz game where users are presented with a series of questions. The user provides input to answer each question, and the program immediately checks if the answer is correct or not. At the end of the quiz, the program displays the total number of correct answers and calculates the user's score as a percentage.

This project is a great way to practice basic Python skills, including handling user input, conditional statements, and loops.

### Project 2: Python Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple and interactive Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game prompts the user to enter a positive integer, which defines the range for a random number to be guessed. The user then attempts to guess the randomly generated number within the specified range. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. 
The game keeps track of the number of guesses taken by the user and displays the total once the correct number is guessed.

## Project 1: [Computer Quiz Project](https://github.com/Amitverma0509/python_projects/blob/main/computer_quiz.py)
- **Features**:
  - User answers a series of questions.
  - Immediate feedback on answers.
  - Final score displays total correct answers and percentage.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - Handling user input
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops
 
## Project 2: [Python Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/Amitverma0509/python_projects/blob/main/guess_number.py)
- **Features**:
  - Validates user input to ensure a positive integer is entered.
  - Generates a random number within the user-defined range.
  - Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
  - Tracks the number of guesses made by the user.
  - Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully without counting them as guesses.

## Project 3: [Stone Paper Scissor game](https://github.com/Amitverma0509/python_projects/blob/main/stone_paper_scissor.py)
- **Features**:
  - **Stone-Paper-Scissor Game**: A simple command-line game where the user competes against the computer.
  - **Win/Loss Tracking**: Keeps track of how many rounds the user and the computer have won.
  - **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback after each round, showing the user's and the computer's choices.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - **Command-Line Interaction**: Built an interactive game that operates entirely in the command line.
  - **User Input Validation**: Learned to validate and process user input effectively.
  - **Control Flow**: Implemented control structures like if-elif-else to determine game outcomes.

## Project 4: [Adventure game](https://github.com/Amitverma0509/python_projects/blob/main/adventure_game.py)
- **Features**:
  - **Error Handlingv: The game has basic error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring that the player is prompted when an incorrect option is chosen.
  - **Story-Driven Gameplay**: The game is designed around a narrative with fantasy elements like dark caves, enchanted trees, and ghostly figures, which provides a thematic experience.
  - **Interactive Narrative**: The game provides an immersive story where the player makes decisions that affect the outcome. This feature makes the game engaging and personalized.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - **String Manipulation**: Handling and comparing strings for user input, which is a fundamental skill in text-based games.
  - **Storytelling in Code**: Integrating storytelling with code logic to create an interactive narrative, which is a useful skill for developing text-based games or interactive fiction.
  - **Error Checking**: Implementing basic checks for valid user inputs to enhance the game's robustness and user experience.

## Project 5: [Alarm Clock](https://github.com/Amitverma0509/python_projects/blob/main/alarm_clock.py)
- **Features**:
  - **Time-based Alarm**: The script allows the user to set a specific time for an alarm, and it checks the current time continuously until the alarm time is reached.
  - **Audio Notification**: When the alarm time is reached, a sound file (`sound_effect.mp3`) is played as the alarm notification using the `pygame` library.
  - **Pygame Integration**: The pygame library is used to handle the playback of the alarm sound, demonstrating how to incorporate multimedia features in Python applications.
  - **User Input**: The user is prompted to input the desired alarm time in HH:MM:SS format.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - **Cross-Module Functionality**: Integrating different Python modules (`datetime`, `pygame`, `time`) to create a cohesive program that combines time management with multimedia playback.
  - **Time Management with `datetime`**: Learning how to work with the datetime module to get the current time and format it appropriately for comparison.

...and more to come!
